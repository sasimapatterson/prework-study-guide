# Prework Study Guide

## Description

We all have different style and pace for learning new things. It can be very hard to absorb information in a short amount of time. This project is created to help bootcamp students keep track of their notes that they have learned during the pre-course. Students can refer to their notes on the Prework Study Guide when they stuck or simply just to refresh the memory.
